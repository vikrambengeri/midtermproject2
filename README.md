Container Based Automation Solution


------------------------------------Goal Of Project------------------------------------------ 
      
The software is a python-based software composed of a frontend UI and a backend consisting of multiple 

web API/microservices that speak to the DynamoDB database to store and retrieve the details.

The goal of this project is to:

 • Create an automatic packaging and deployment solution to deploy this application
 
 • Create docker files to deploy python web APIs on containers
 
 • Use AWS EKS to deploy the containers as it helps in easy portability of application and easier unit 

testing
 
 • DynamoDB can be used for storage. It gives you the flexibility of high performance with significantly 

less maintenance

• Create CloudFormation script files to automate the creation of a stack containing the various 

components on the cloud. This helps to ensure that the stacks can be created consistently the same 

way and implements IaaC (infrastructure as a code)

• Monitor the database growth rate with the CloudWatch dashboard. AWS CloudWatch provides a 

unified service for all monitoring purposes of applications/database hosted on AWS

• Create necessary tables in Athena. Athena helps us to directly read data from S3 files, which is both 

economical and also gives you the flexibility of an RDBMS solution
